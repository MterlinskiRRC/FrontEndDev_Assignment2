    Can I explain what my code does?
       The code I have is a really simple Resume for Batman, it lays out the important details in nice easy to read lists. I made use of the various Header sizes available and added in graphics for added flair. The alt text descriptions seem to be fucntional as well.


    What was my coding process?
        Basically I just followed the assignment steps in order and used the template as a guide to help me along as needed and pulled the various images from google where necessary/


    What challenges did I have?
        Most of my challenges were not HTML related but rather with Git/VSC being stubborn and not wanting to sync properly... something with the credentials manager? so that killed a lot of time trying to diagnose and fix the issues and I ended up losing a lot of progress there.

    What would I do differently now?
        Commited and pushed more often, again a I feel like that answer isn't directly assignment/material related sorry.. The technical issues aside I only read the details on "must have 10 commits" part way through as well and I kind of felt that was unnecessary ad the "content" could have been 1, the pictures 2 and then?? without having to do styling it felt a bit sparse.
