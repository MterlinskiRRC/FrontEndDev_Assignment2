    Can I explain what my code does?
       The code I have is a really simple Resume for Batman, it lays out the important details in nice easy to read lists. I made use of the various Header sizes available and added in graphics for added flair. The alt text descriptions seem to be functional as well.


    What was my coding process?
        Basically I just followed the assignment steps in order and used the template as a guide to help me along as needed and pulled the various images from google where necessary. I did the acessability check using the website provided.


    What challenges did I have?
        Most of my challenges were not HTML related but rather with Git/VSC being stubborn and not wanting to sync properly... something with the credentials manager? so that killed a lot of time trying to diagnose and fix the issues and I ended up losing a decent chunk of progress there.. 30 minutes of the hour I had done :( .

    What would I do differently now?
        Committed and pushed more often, again a I feel like that answer isn't directly assignment/material related sorry.. Make sure that any tools are working as intended before continuing onto the rest opf the assignments.
        The technical issues aside I only read the details on "must have 10 commits" part way through as well and I kind of felt that was unnecessary ad the "content" could have been 1, the pictures 2 and then?? without having to do styling it felt a bit sparse.



Assignment 2:



Can I explain what my code does?

    It's a resume for batman with colors and styling added via css.... I can explain the colors and the margins, the sizing and the location of the various items...

What was my coding process?

    Take the base resume from assignment one and added the styles css file and then broke it down into components parts each getting it's own attributes as needed (colour, font, size, justifcation etc..)

What challenges did I have?

    I'm used to just slapping down inline CSS so having a separate file like this took a few minutes to get used to.

What would I do differently now?

    It's all a matter of setup, this took longer than it needed to because the base assignment 1 was not set in separate tags that were needed.. would spend a bit more time while starting
